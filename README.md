Welcome to the Star Schema in Power BI project repository! This guide will walk you through setting up a star schema using two fact tablesâ€”Movie Sales and Movie Rankingâ€”and a shared Movie Dimension table. It also covers best practices to ensure your model is clean and effective.

 Steps to Build the Star Schema:
1. Create the Movie Dimension Table
Begin by setting up a dimension table that will serve as the central connection between your fact tables.
2. Remove Duplicate Entries
Ensure your Movie Dimension table has unique entries by eliminating any duplicates.
3. Add a Surrogate Key
Add a surrogate key to the dimension table for easy identification and linking.
4. Link Movie Dimension with FactMovieSales
Connect the Movie Dimension table with the FactMovieSales table using the surrogate key.
5. Check for Missing MovieKeys
Ensure all movie keys in your fact tables match the keys in the dimension table.
6. Repeat for FactMovieRanking
Repeat the above steps for the FactMovieRanking table.
7. Load Tables into Power BI
Import all your tables into Power BI.
8. Establish Relationships in Power BI
Use Power BI's relationship manager to link the fact and dimension tables.
9. Build Your Visualizations
Finally, build meaningful and insightful visualizations using your star schema structure.
ðŸ’¡ Best Practices for Building a Star Schema in Power BI:

ðŸŸ¢ Keep It Simple: Aim for a clean and easy-to-understand model.

ðŸŸ¢ Use Surrogate Keys: These simplify relationships and reduce complexity.

ðŸŸ¢ Maintain Consistency: Ensure consistent data formats and naming conventions.

ðŸŸ¢ Remove Duplicates: Duplicates can cause erroneous relationships and bloated data models.

ðŸŸ¢ Optimize Storage: Compress data where possible and avoid redundancy.

ðŸŸ¢ Clean Your Data: Always clean and pre-process your data before loading it into Power BI.

ðŸŸ¢ Hide Technical Fields: Hide columns like surrogate keys and other technical fields from end users.

ðŸŸ¢ Maintain a Master List: Keep an updated master list of all entities and their relationships.

ðŸŸ¢ Validate Relationships: Always check relationships to ensure there are no ambiguous or incorrect joins.

ðŸŸ¢ Plan for Scalability: Structure your model so it can handle additional data as it grows.

By following this guide and adhering to the best practices listed above, you'll create a well-organized and efficient star schema in Power BI. This structure simplifies your data model and enhances your ability to generate meaningful reports on movie sales and rankings.
